# Project-2-Game
# Euromast Rotterdam

This game was a project I did for my study at Hogeschool Rotterdam, this is als the first game I ever created. 

It is build in Python with the game engine pygame, the original version was build in Python 3.2 and pygame 3.2, but verry soon after the project was done new versions of Python came out. So I spend some time rebuilding the game and went through all my dirty spaghetti code, if I had to re-do this project I had done it way differntly. 

The result of the re-build of the game, was the same game written for Python 3.6 and pygame 3.6, I also removed the database since it was a local PostgreSQL database and I didn't want to re-configure the database. So you cannot store the highscore anymore eventually, it should have been better to use a local SQLite database, wich you can easily transfer to the cloud and other machines. 

## To run this project
If you want to play this game just download Euromast The game folder and make sure Python 3.6 is installed, you also should run the pip install pygame command. After this your good to and you can run python game.py to play the game. 

### have fun
